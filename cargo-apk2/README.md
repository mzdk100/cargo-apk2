Tool for creating Android packages from native Rust crates. We have created this tool because the predecessor of this tool ([`cargo-apk`]) has stagnated for over a year at the time of writing this documentation.

This tool requires minimal setup and tooling, without the requirement of Gradle configuration. Ideal for apps that provide a [`NativeActivity`] via [`android-activity`] and [`ndk`].

In addition to features available in `cargo-apk`, this tool supports compiling sources of JVM-based languages into DEX data to be packaged in the APK file; declaration of multiple activities and even services are supported.

[`cargo-apk`]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-apk
[`NativeActivity`]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NativeActivity
[`android-activity`]: https://crates.io/crates/android-activity
[`ndk`]: https://crates.io/crates/ndk

## Installation

From crates.io:

```shell
cargo install cargo-apk2
```

From locally downloaded or cloned source:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mzdk100/cargo-apk2
cargo install --path cargo-apk2/
```

## Crate configuration

Android and thus `cargo-apk` require the [Cargo Target] to be a Shared Library, corresponding to Rust's `cdylib` `crate-type`.  For the sole library in a crate, configure this as follows in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[lib]
# Optionally supports a different library location using `path = "..."`
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

The source repository of this tool provides some example configurations.

[Cargo Target]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html

## Commands

- `build`: Compile the selected crate and package it into an APK
- `run`: Compile, install and run the selected crate/package on an attached Android device via `adb`
- `gdb`: Start a gdb session on an attached Android device via `adb`, with symbols loaded

## Manifest

`cargo apk` reads additional configuration from Cargo's `[package.metadata]` table. The following configuration options are supported by `cargo apk` under `[package.metadata.android]`:

```toml
[package.metadata.android]
# Use `aapt2` instead of `aapt` for compiling application resources.
use_aapt2 = true

# Specifies the package property of the manifest.
# See https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element#package
package = "com.foo.bar"

# Specifies the array of targets to build for.
build_targets = [ "armv7-linux-androideabi", "aarch64-linux-android", "i686-linux-android", "x86_64-linux-android" ]

# Path to your application's resources folder.
# If not specified, resources will not be included in the APK.
resources = "path/to/resources_folder"

# Path to the folder containing your application's assets.
# If not specified, assets will not be included in the APK.
assets = "path/to/assets_folder"

# Directory path of Java source files.
# If not specified, the Java compilation process might be skipped.
java_sources = "path/to/java"

# Directory path of Kotlin source files.
# If not specified, the Kotlin compilation process will be skipped.
kotlin_sources = "path/to/kotlin"

# Directory path of Groovy source files.
# If not specified, the Groovy compilation process will be skipped.
kotlin_sources = "path/to/groovy"

# Directory path of Scala source files.
# If not specified, the Scala compilation process will be skipped.
kotlin_sources = "path/to/scala"

# Name for final APK file.
# Defaults to package name.
apk_name = "myapp"

# `default` (or unspecified) - Debug symbols, if they exist, are not treated
#                              specially.
#
# `strip`                    - Debug symbols are stripped from the shared
#                              libraries before being copied into the APK.
#
# `split`                    - Functions the same as `strip`, except the debug
#                              symbols are written to the apk output directory
#                              alongside the stripped shared libraries, with
#                              a `.dwarf` extension.
#
# Note that the `strip` and `split` options will only have an effect if
# debug symbols are present in the `.so` file(s) produced by your build, enabling
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#strip or
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html#split-debuginfo

# in the `.so`.

# according to the specified build_targets.

# The name of a Linux user ID that is shared with other apps. By
# default, Android assigns each app its own unique user ID. However, if
# this attribute is set to the same value for two or more apps, they all
# share the same ID, provided that their certificate sets are identical.
# Apps with the same user ID can access each other's data and, if
# desired, run in the same process.
shared_user_id = "my.shared.user.id"

# Defaults to `$HOME/.android/debug.keystore` for the `dev` profile. Will ONLY
# generate a new debug.keystore if this file does NOT exist. A keystore is never
# auto-generated for other profiles.
#
# The keystore path can be absolute, or relative to the Cargo.toml file.
#
# The environment variables `CARGO_APK_<PROFILE>_KEYSTORE` and
# `CARGO_APK_<PROFILE>_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` can be set to a keystore path
# and keystore password respectively. The profile portion follows the same rules
# as `<cfg>`, it is the uppercased profile name with `-` replaced with `_`.

# The name of the Service subclass that implements the service. This is a fully qualified

# first character of the name is a period, such as ".RoomService", it is appended to the
# package name specified in the <manifest> element.
# Once you publish your application, don't change this name, unless you set
# `android:exported="false"`. There is no default. The name must be specified. 
name = ".MyService"

# Whether the service can be instantiated by the system. It's "true" if it can be, and
# "false" if not. The default value is "true".
# The <application> element has its own enabled attribute that applies to all application
# components, including services. The <application> and <service> attributes must both be
# "true", as they both are by default, for the service to be enabled. If either is "false",
# the service is disabled and can't be instantiated.

# If a caller of startService(), bindService(), or stopService() isn't granted this permission,
# the method doesn't work and the Intent object isn't delivered to the service.

# attribute applies to the service. If neither attribute is set, the service isn't protected
# by a permission. 
permission = "android.permission.BIND_JOB_SERVICE"

# The name of the process where the service runs. Normally, all components of an application
# run in the default process created for the application. It has the same name as the
# application package. The <application> element's process attribute can set a different
# default for all components. But a component can override the default with its own process
# attribute, letting you spread your application across multiple processes.
# If the name assigned to this attribute begins with a colon (:), a new process, private to
# the application, is created when it's needed and the service runs in that process.
# If the process name begins with a lowercase character, the service runs in a global process
# of that name, provided that it has permission to do so. This lets components in different
# applications share a process, reducing resource usage.

# Set up reverse port forwarding through `adb reverse`, meaning that if the
# Android device connects to `localhost` on port `1338` it will be routed to
# the host on port `1338` instead. Source and destination ports can differ,
# see the `adb` help page for possible configurations.

If a manifest attribute is not supported by `cargo apk2`, feel free to create a PR that adds the missing attribute.
